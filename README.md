## Web Application Development ECOM 5410, Lab2
This is the second lab of the Web Application Development course ECOM 5410, that covers **the basics of CSS**.


:clipboard: __The scenario| Chong Qing House is planning on holding a Noodle Night, but they havenâ€™t figured out what music to play for their customers.
                   They have found a database of over 2 million music CDs which they want to search through. For each CD, there is the title, the artist name, and the list of                        tracks. Each track has a song name and an artist name. Other information (e.g. length of tracks, genre, notes) is available as well.__  
 
#### _Create and design a frontend for this scenario_
You are responsible for creating at least **3 HTML pages**: 
 1. An __index.html__ home page for input (query). 
 2. A __results.html__ page that displays a list of possible CD outputs (can be static results regardless of unique queries). 
 3. At least one __CD html page__, the result of clicking on one of the CD outputs in the results page.   
    This page should have all of the information about the selected CD in it. 
 4. push your code to the Github as you learn from previous lab. 
 In addition, you are expected to style these pages with CSS. For instance, the list items of the results page should be styled to distinguish them 
 (e.g. border, background-color, etc).
  
> __Link up these html pages. At the most basic level, the user should be able to reach the results page from the index page, and a CD page by clicking the corresponding result on 
  the results page.__
